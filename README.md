The temperatures are hottest below the equator and up to the equator and then begin to drop really low once we get into the Northern Hemisphere. 

There were more cities that came up with a higher humidity percentaage in the northern hemisphere. 

Most wind speeds were between 0 - 10 mph in the study.

There is a strong negative regression when looking at the max temperatures in the northern hemisphere as temps drop closer to the north pole. 

There is a small positive regression with max temperatures in the southen hemisphere as we near the equator were temps start to get higher. 

There are positive regressions in humidity percentage in both the southern and northern hemispheres. But the humidity rises as we get away from the equator in the north but the humidity rises in the south as we approach the equator. 

WeatherPy.ipynb is the first file to view that calls the openweathermap API and creates weatherpy.csv  

VacationPy.ipynb is the second file to view that reads weatherpy.csv and uses Gmaps to view top vacation destinations. Notebook will have to be run in order to view the map.
